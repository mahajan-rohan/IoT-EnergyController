# Machine Learning and IoT-Based Intelligent Energy Monitoring and Prediction System

## Project Description

This project is focused on **intelligent energy monitoring and prediction** using a combination of **IoT (Internet of Things)** and **machine learning**. The system collects real-time energy readings from IoT devices and uses machine learning algorithms to predict future power consumption trends.

### Key Features:
1. **IoT-Based Energy Monitoring**: 
   - The IoT devices monitor critical parameters such as voltage, current, power factor, and energy consumption in real-time.
   - Sensors send these readings to the microcontroller, which processes and transmits the data to the server using GSM/GPRS modules.
   
2. **Machine Learning for Prediction**:
   - Collected data is used to predict future energy consumption trends.
   - Machine learning models analyze patterns in the data to anticipate peak energy demands and potential power outages.
   
3. **Real-Time Alerts**:
   - The system sends **SMS alerts** to the user for specific events like **low voltage, high voltage, or short circuits**.
   - Alerts are also sent to the local fire department in case of short circuit detection.
   
4. **Daily Usage Notifications**:
   - Daily energy consumption summaries are sent to users to help them keep track of their usage.

5. **User-Friendly Visuals**:
   - The system provides easy-to-understand graphical representations of predicted energy consumption trends.

## Temperature Sensor and Relay Control Code

### Overview:
This code is part of the intelligent energy monitoring system where a **relay module** is controlled based on the readings from a **temperature sensor**. The system turns the relay **off** when the temperature exceeds or equals a defined threshold, and turns it **on** when the temperature drops below this threshold. This mechanism is useful in controlling devices such as heaters, fans, or cooling systems.

### Components:
- **DS18B20 Temperature Sensor**: Measures the temperature and sends the data to the microcontroller.
- **Relay Module**: Controls external devices based on the temperature.
- **Arduino Uno**: The microcontroller responsible for processing the data from the sensor and controlling the relay.
  
### Functionality:
1. **Temperature Monitoring**:
   - The DS18B20 sensor continuously reads the temperature in degrees Celsius.
   - The readings are displayed in both **Celsius** and **Fahrenheit** on the serial monitor for easy debugging.
   
2. **Relay Control**:
   - When the temperature is **greater than or equal to** the specified threshold (e.g., 30Â°C), the relay turns **off**.
   - When the temperature drops **below** the threshold, the relay turns **on**.

3. **LED Indicator**:
   - An LED is used to indicate the state of the relay: 
     - **ON** when the relay is **off** (high temperature).
     - **OFF** when the relay is **on** (low temperature).
